                <h3>Piazzas serve a critical function as social hubs in Arezzo. They are open, communal, and a gathering site for all ages and interests. Squares support a myriad of businesses, but there is no obligation to spend money while there because of the public nature of a piazza. This allows for citizens at all levels of society to come together in a shared space. Within piazzas, aspects of culture such as globalization, tourism, and social interactions are on display.</h5>

                            <p>Piazza San Francesco is a small square located off of the main street of Arezzo. In the piazza stands a beautiful church which can be toured during the day. The piazza also has two main restaurants with outdoor seating that
                                takes up the majority of the square. At night, the piazza is packed with Arezzo’s working class citizens and is much fancier than the Piazza Grande and San Augustino. It isn’t uncommon, however, to find young adults who
                                meet up for a drink and an apertivo here. The restaurants here are also a popular destination for couples to enjoy a nice evening eating pizza, salad and small appetizers. Children also can be seen playing along the front
                                steps of the small church here.

                            <p>As darkness fell on the piazza, there were clearly two different types of patrons. The first group was young and well dressed. Most looked to be in their late twenties and came in groups of three to five. The lights from the
                                largest restaurant sparkled throughout the piazza, bouncing off of the wine glasses held in most young hands. The young adults congregated at a wine bar and a craft beer joint inside the piazza, and almost all of them were
                                sipping on an alcoholic drink. The remainder of the patrons was families with young children. One restaurant, Caffe Dei Constanti, had the largest amount of room in the piazza and most of its outdoor tables were swarming
                                with children under the age of about ten. The raised, open space in front of the church was devoted completely to children. Parents would sit at their tables and watch as their kids darted around the piazza. A few children
                                were playing with a soccer ball that kept being kicked down the steps and into the tables. Some children had bikes or scooters that they coasted around on. Two dark skinned girls dressed in white were spinning in circles
                                to make their dresses flap up. They looked like sisters. The younger girl was holding a white purse on a gold chain while she was spinning. She let go of the chain and threw it up. Her older sister tried to catch it, but
                                she quickly retracted her hands when the gold metal slapped her hands. The girls got tired of spinning, so they began to recreate partner ballet poses. When one move went wrong and they lost their balance, the sisters devolved
                                in giggles that echoed around the piazza.</p>

                            <p>One of the two restaurants located in Piazza San Francesco – it seems to be the more popular of the two. One can order pizza, salad, appetizers, and apertivo, along with a wide selection of cocktail drinks. The drinks are excellently
                                made as well! Inside the café, there is a bar where one can order pastries, coffee, and small finger foods, which are displayed behind glass windows along the counters. The inside of the restaurant is also beautifully designed,
                                although most people choose to eat outside in the cool evening air.

                            <p>Piazza Grande, as the name suggests, is the largest piazza in Arezzo. Two churches stand along one side of the square, beautifully carved of towering stone. Pubs and restaurants also line the sides of the square, although none
                                of us have been to any of them. In the far corner of the square, behind the small well, are a cluster of shops where visitors may buy souvenirs, clay pottery, and antiques. All over the buildings hang many different colored
                                flags, each representing a different section of the town. During a certain time of the year, the square is turned into a medieval arena where a jousting tournament is held for the whole town. The Piazza Grande is one of
                                the more subdued squares in Arezzo. It is a popular spot for families and tourists to sit and enjoy the beautiful piazza. During the evening, the cafes are typically full of families eating dinner, and the pub across the
                                street is also popular.

                            <p>The piazza was sparsely populated. The open area in the center had no tables or steps, so the center was mostly for pedestrians walking through and visitors snapping pictures of the historic square. Tourists took turns standing
                                in the center circle with their cameras pressed to their faces. We watched from our space on the steps before the church while visitors spun around inside the circle. The square shape of the piazza makes it easy to see
                                the entire space from one vantage point. One young couple took a video selfie while spinning an entire rotation with huge smiles on their faces. Many of the tourists present came with their children. One father trailed
                                after his toddler as they waddled in circles around the empty center. When the child was swooped up and carried away towards the rest of the family, they flapped their legs wildly in their father's arms. Behind us on the
                                steps, a German couple and their three young children spent fifteen minutes cooling off and rehydrating. The children babbled away while the parents listened quietly. Another child, a boy around four years old, came up
                                the slanted piazza trailed by two men and a younger girl in a stroller. The toddler's shirt read "six months of vacation twice a year."

                            <p> By far the most popular of these piazzas, San Augustino is a hub of bars and gelaterias. The piazza itself is located off of the corso, the main street of Arezzo where many clothing stores are located. During the day, young
                                adults can be found at the bars, grabbing a quick espresso or a drink. Teenagers also gather here in groups to hang out together, clustering around the gelateria shops. On certain days of the week, a morning market dominates
                                the large square in front of the church. Locals come to by discounted clothing, shoes, or household supplies from the booths that are set up. It is a wonderful spot for the older generation of Italians. At night, the piazza
                                transforms into a social hub – the square is packed with many young people and families. It isn’t uncommon for the city to be putting on some sort of event for the crowd, such as movie showings, concerts, performances,
                                and even showing major soccer games. People pack the seats of the two bars located in the piazza for hours on end and it isn’t out of place to see small children gathered together playing at late hours of the night. With
                                many wonderful places to eat and a vibrant nightlife, it is no wonder why locals gather en masse here in San Augustino.

                            <p>Aurora is a popular destination for young adults in San Augustino. During the day, the bar may not seem like much. But during the evening, the bar is packed with young adults gathering together to grab drinks. The bar is run
                                by a man named Chico, the “Communist King of Arezzo”. One of his most popular phrases is finito giacho, meaning that the bar has run out of ice. On a busy night at the bar, it is very common for Chico to run out of ice
                                for drinks. It’s not too much of a problem for some though, as instead of coming with ice, the cocktails come with twice as much alcohol!

                                but during the evening it is far more common to sit outside where one can enjoy the fresh air. The restaurant itself has many typical Italian foods, such as pasta, salads, and of course, pizza. It is also a very popular
                                place to grab a nice glass of wine while you eat. During the day, the restaurant is open, but few people seem to frequent it for lunch. At night, however, the outdoor seating area is backed with families, couples, and young

                                his sketch in Italian. Even though he must have noticed that he was in the way of our lines of sight for our drawing, the group remained in their inconvenient position. All of the teens were dressed in a style consistent
                                with American fashions, featuring Nikes, Chuck Taylors, and Daisy Dukes. One of the two girls was dressed in a particularly interedting way. She looked to be about 15 with long, straight, brown hair with blonde highlights.
                                The mascara she was wearing made her eyelashes long and spidery and her eyeshadow added a shimmery glow to her face. Her denim shorts were tight and short with a few sparkly gems on the back pockets. Her red bra was visible
                                beneath her tight, white tank top. The tank top had a cactus on the front with the words from an American country song written around the cactus. The shirt read "you and tequila make me crazy."

                            <p>After dark, we returned to the bench outside Cheri that we had monopolized earlier that day. This gave us a clear vantage point of the wine bar across the piazza, Il Botterghino. Throughout the course of an hour, we watched
                                a bad date play out at a table in front of the wine bar. The man had an impressive and groomed mustache, round and thick glasses, pants cuffed at the bottom, and loafers. The woman had mousy brown hair, jeans, a tan tank
                                top, and black platform heels. They were sitting on tall stools at a table beside the door to the bar. The man was gesturing wildly while holding a potato chip between his fingers. He was positioned with his knees towards
                                her, leaning in with his elbow resting on his knee and his forearm stretched towards his date. In contrast, she was leaning away from him, keeping her hands close to her body to avoid bridging the gap between his outstretched
                                hands and hers. She rubbed her eyes and reclined further. He lit a cigarette and crossed his legs so that his body was angled even closer towards her. She slouched even more and held her own hands in her lap. She appeared
                                to be paying his words little attention. She rarely chipped in anything, but perhaps she couldn't get a word in edgewise. Her glass of pink wine was empty but she continued to twirl the glass between her fingers. He lit
                                another cigarette and she covered her mouth with her hand. She began to dig in her purse, then applied lipstick and lit a cigarette of her own. They both fiddled on their phones and she avoided eye contact with him. After
                                they put their phones up, he seemed to get brave and reached his hand across the space between them, only to have her retract her hands and sit on them. He touched her knee and she continued to keep her distance. The man
                                again pulled out his phone, this time to snap a picture of the bottles of wine on the wall beside their table. He casually leaned in towards her under the guise of taking a selfie. She humored him but barely glanced at
                                the camera before returning to her phone. He lit a third cigarette.</p>
